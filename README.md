# Local conservation status for Natura 2000 habitats in Flanders

The `LSVI` package bundles a number of functions to support researchers studying the local conservation status of habitats. Several functions give information on the criteria that are used to determine the local conservation status in Flanders, others allow to calculate the conservation status. Criteria are stored in a database, which is indispensable for running functions. (The database is now external for development reasons, but it will be integrated in the package as soon as it is completed).

The package is written in Dutch.

# Installation

To install the development version, start a new R session and run this code (before loading any packages). 

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("inbo/LSVI@develop", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))
```

To have access to the database (which is a precondition for using the package), one should be logged in as a user on the INBO network (locally or by using VPN).

# Documentation

After installation, a user manual is available by running this code:

```r
vignette("Handleiding", package = "LSVI")
```

# Citation

Please use the output of `citation("LSVI")`
